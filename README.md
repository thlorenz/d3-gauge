# d3-gauge

Gauge visualization built on top of d3.

[![demo](https://github.com/thlorenz/d3-gauge/raw/master/assets/gauge-demo.gif)]()

```js
var d3gauge = require('d3-gauge');

// 
var gauge = d3gauge(document.getElementById('simple-gauge'));
gauge.write(39);
```

**Note:** please make sure to [include the appropriate `css`](#styling) in your page, otherwise all you'll see is a big black
circle.

## Installation

    npm install d3-gauge
## Try it

```sh
npm explore d3-gauge
npm run demo
```

## API

####gauge (el[, opts])*

Creates a gauge appended to the given DOM element.

@name Gauge
@function
**params:**

- el *DOMElement* to which the gauge is appended
- opts *Object* gauge configuration with the following properties all of which have sensible defaults:
  - label {String} that appears in the top portion of the gauge
  - clazz {String} class to apply to the gauge element in order to support custom styling
  - size {Number} the over all size (radius) of the gauge
  - min {Number} the minimum value that the gauge measures
  - max {Number} the maximum value that the gauge measures
  - majorTicks {Number} the number of major ticks to draw
  - minorTicks {Number} the number of minor ticks to draw in between two major ticks
  - needleWidthRatio {Number} tweaks the gauge's needle width
  - needleConatinerRadiusRatio {Number} tweaks the gauge's needle container circumference
  - transitionDuration {Number} the time in ms it takes for the needle to move to a new position
  - zones {Array[Object]} each with the following properties
      - clazz {String} class to apply to the zone element in order to style its fill
      - from {Number} between 0 and 1 to determine zone's start
      - to {Number} between 0 and 1 to determine zone's end

**returns:**

*Object* the gauge with a `write` method

**Note:** have a look at the [default opts](https://github.com/thlorenz/d3-gauge/blob/master/defaults/simple.js)

###*gauge.write = function(value, transitionDuration)*

Writes a value to the gauge and updates its state, i.e. needle position, accordingly.
@name write
@function
**params:**

- value *Number* the new gauge value, should be in between min and max
- transitionDuration *Number* (optional) transition duration, if not supplied the configured duration is used

## Styling

d3-gauge can be custom styled and none of the features are visible if no style is included at all.

Please have a look [at the styles included here](https://github.com/thlorenz/d3-gauge/tree/master/defaults) in order to
get an idea of what parts you can tweak to your liking.

## Kudos

This implementation was highly inspired by [this post](http://bl.ocks.org/tomerd/1499279).

Although lots of work went into cleaning the code up and making the gauge configurable and stylable, the main idea came
from there.
